![Abhilasha Kumar headshot](kumar-thumbnail.png)
**Abhilasha Kumar**: [Hear my name](https://www.name-coach.com/abhilasha-kumar)!<br>
**pronouns**: she/her<br>
**bio**: I am a cognitive scientist who is fascinated by how humans think, learn, and communicate. My [work](https://thelexiconlab.github.io/research/) involves conducting psychological experiments to understand different aspects of human behavior such as how we learn the meaning of words, how we search for information, and how we cooperate with one another. When I am not working, I enjoy playing board games, learning new cocktail and baking recipes, and playing tennis (badly)! <br>
**email**: a.kumar@bowdoin.edu <br>
**office**: Kanbar Hall, Room 217 <br>
**student/office hours**: 

You are **strongly encouraged** to drop-in during student/office hours - this is time specifically dedicated to **you** and any thoughts, questions, or concerns you may wish to share with me. If the designated hours don't work for you, please email me to find a different time or [schedule an appointment]().

## What is this course about?

The mind is one of the biggest human puzzles, and scientific exploration of different aspects of the mind is the central goal of cognitive science. This lab course will expose you to modern techniques used in cognitive science that can be applied to the study of cognition. Together, we will learn how to develop a research question, conceptualize scientific experiments from start to finish, analyze experimental data, and communcate important insights about human cognition.

## Why take this course? a.k.a. learning goals

In addition to delving into some key aspects of cognition, my hope as an instructor is to **empower** you with an analytical toolkit that can be applied to other areas of your life. At the end of this course, my hope is that you will be able to: <br>
1. <span style="color:#508AB0">Design</span> and conduct a web-based experiment about cognition 
2. Describe and <span style="color:#E7AC10">analyze</span> data 
3. <span style="color:#B321EE">Communicate</span> scientific findings

In achieving these learning goals, we will also emphasize and adopt **open science** practices, that are central to conducting robust scientific research. 

If some or all of this is new to you, then this is the **perfect** course for you! The course is aimed at beginners with little to no technical or programming background. If you have questions, feel free to reach out!

## How will we communicate? 
The majority of our communication will occur via Canvas. Assignments will be posted and submitted on Canvas and questions about the course or the content can also be posted on Canvas. I and other classmates will respond to questions on Canvas so everyone has access to the questions and responses. Email will also be used regularly as part of this course. As much as possible, I will respond within 24 hours to emails with the exception that anything sent after 5pm on Fridays will not be addressed until Monday morning at the earliest. To meet with me individually, contact me via email.
