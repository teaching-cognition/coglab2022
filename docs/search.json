    "text": "This page consists resources for writing QALMRIs.\nYou will write QALMRIs for your final project. This page is intended to help you understand the elements of a good and thorough QALMRI.\nAcknowledgement: The QALMRI method was first introduced by:\n\nKosslyn, S. M., & Rosenberg, R. S. (2001). Psychology: The Brain, The Person, The World. Boston: Allyn & Bacon\n\nThe description of the QALMRI method below is from Dr. Matthew J. C. Crump’s textbook:\n\nMatthew J. C. Crump. (2021). Instances of Cognition: Questions, Methods, Findings, Explanations, Applications, and Implications. https://crumplab.com/cognition/textbook\n\nQALMRI is an acronym for critical parts of research articles. It stands for Question, Alternatives, Logic, Method, Results, and Inference. This section demonstrates using QALMRI as a guide for reading a primary research article. QALMRI can also be used as an activity or assignment, and an example of a QALMRI assignment is given at the end.\n\nFinding a paper\nThe first step is to find a primary research article to read. To demonstrate QALMRI, I chose a paper from my own research. The article is titled, “Warning: this keyboard will deconstruct – The role of the keyboard in skilled typewriting”. This paper was published in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review in 2010 and can be freely downloaded as a pdf here.\nBefore continuing, I suggest you download the paper and give it a quick glance. It it is only 5 pages long.\n\n\nAnatomy of a primary research article\nThe paper you just downloaded is an example of a primary research article. The pieces of different research articles are very similar. For example, this one has a title, an abstract, an introduction, methods and results sections for two experiments, a general discussion, and references. Most research papers have similar components:\n\nTitle: The concise title captures the main focus of the study.\nAbstract: The brief summary provides an overview of the research objectives, methods, key findings, and significance.\nIntroduction: This section presents background information, previous research, and identifies gaps in knowledge.\nMethods: The section describes the study design, sample size, data collection procedures, and statistical analysis methods.\nResults: The findings of the study are presented objectively, using data tables, figures, or graphs.\nGeneral Discussion: This section interprets the results, discusses implications, limitations, and future research directions.\nReferences: A list of cited sources, following a specific citation format, allows readers to access the cited works.\n\nBy adhering to this structure, a primary research article ensures clarity, transparency, and replicability, enabling evaluation of the study’s validity and significance.\nResearch papers are often written for a technical audience, which refers to other researchers who are already familiar with the domain. As a result, students may find it challenging to extract and comprehend major points of research articles. We will use QALMRI as an aid to help you identify and comprehend the components of a research paper.\n\n\nWhat does QALMRI stand for?\n\nQ stands for Question\nResearchers ask and answer research questions. So, your first task is to identify what questions are being asked in the research article. Research questions are usually stated in the abstract or the introduction, and sometimes they are restated near the beginning of the general discussion.\nYou may notice many different kinds of questions being stated in a research paper. It is helpful to distinguish between broad questions and specific questions. A single research paper is rarely capable of answering very broad questions, but it may have answered a specific question.\nThe paper you downloaded is about cognitive abilities mediating skilled typewriting on a computer keyboard. This topic is associated with many broad questions. For example, how do people control their own body movements? How do people learn to type without thinking about what their fingers are doing? How do people learn skills? How do people learn language? All of these questions are too big for a single research paper to answer.\nThe paper also asks specific questions. The overarching specific question is about how the feeling of the keyboard influences typing performance. People can type on keyboards with keys, or on flat surfaces without keys. How does tactile feedback from the keyboard influence typing performance?\n\n\nA stands for Alternatives\nExperimental research in cognition is often designed to test alternative explanations or hypotheses about a cognitive ability. When reading a paper you should attempt to identify the alternative explanations or hypotheses being discussed. Note also, sometimes a paper may only discuss one alternative hypothesis. More important, the alternative or hypothesis should contain an implication that can be tested later on.\nThe example paper has two major alternative ideas about cognitive processes in typing behavior. Both alternatives provide ideas about how people are able to move their fingers to individual keys very quickly and accurately, even without looking at the keyboard.\nOne possibility is that people have an internal cognitive map of the keyboard. The cognitive map represents the location of the keys on a computer, and typists may use this internal “mind” map to direct their fingers to appropriate locations while typing. An implication of the cognitive map idea is that typists may not need to rely on the feeling or touch of a keyboard in order to type quickly and accurately. Instead, their fingers can move to each key based entirely on directions from the internal map.\nAn alternative possibility is that people do not use an internal map of the keyboard. Instead, people may learn associations between the finger movements required for each keystroke and they way they feel (tactile, haptic, and proprioceptive feedback). An implication of this idea is that feeling the keyboard may be an important component of typing skill, especially for typists who learned to type on keyboards with keys.\n\n\nL stands for Logic\nThe logic of the alternatives or hypotheses is nearly identical to the hypotheses themselves, but more formally stated in terms of if/then statements. Here are two example logic statements for each of the alternatives discussed above:\nIF typists use an internal cognitive map that does not require feedback from the keyboard to guide their fingers, THEN typing performance should not be influenced by manipulations that remove tactile feedback, such as typing on keys vs a flat surface.\nIF typists use feedback from the keyboard to guide their fingers, THEN typing performance should be influenced by manipulations that remove tactile feedback, such as typing on keys vs a flat surface.\n\n\nM stands for Method\nThe method refers to the tools used to answer the research questions. More specifically, the method will usually be carefully designed to test the logical implications of the alternative explanations. In experimental research, the method will involve at least one independent variable or manipulation, and at least one dependent variable or measurement.\nIn our example, the method involved having skilled typists copy text while they were typing on keyboards with different surfaces, that provided less and less tactile feedback. The primary manipulation had four levels, and involved changing the feeling of the keyboard: there was a regular keyboard, a rubber button keyboard, a flat surface keyboard, and a laser projection keyboard. Measurements of typing performance (keystroke typing times and accuracy) were collected for each typist as they typed words on each keyboard.\n\n\nR stands for Results\nThe results are a final product of the research cycle. A given research article may present many results depending on the complexity of the method. In general, the results refer to an analysis of whether the experimental manipulation influenced the measurements.\nIn our example, typing performance was measured for four different keyboards. Results were reported in a graph and showing different measures of typing performance, such as reaction time (time to start typing a word), inter-keystroke interval (time between keystrokes), and error rate. The major result was that typing performance WAS influenced by the keyboard manipulation. Typists were fastest and most accurate on a regular keyboard, and always slower and less accurate on the keyboards with less tactile feedback.\n\n\nI stands for Inferences\nInferences may be the most important product of a research project. Inferences connect the results back to the original research questions. So, what inferences about the alternative explanations under investigation can we draw based on the results of the research? Inferences are possible if the methods do a good job of testing the logic of the alternatives.\nIn our example, the logic of the internal keyboard map idea suggested that manipulations to the feeling of the keyboard should not influence typing performance. However, the results of the study showed that reducing tactile feedback from the keyboard causes slower and more error-prone typing. So, one inference from the study could be that typists do not rely upon an internal map of the keyboard.\n\n\n\nWriting a QALMRI summary\nWriting a QALMRI for any research paper (one that you are writing, or one that you are reading) involves writing short answers to each of the QALMRI points using clear and concise language. It is a condensed, short-form, version of the research. Your task is to answer these questions:\n\nQuestion: What was the broad question? What was the specific question?\nAlternative hypotheses: What were the hypotheses?\nLogic: If hypothesis 1 was true, what was the predicted outcome? What was the predicted outcome if hypothesis 2 was true?\nMethod: What was the experimental design?\nResults: What was the pattern of data?\nInferences: What can be concluded about the hypotheses based on the data? What can be concluded about the specific and broad question? What are the next steps?\n\n\n\nExample QALMRI\nEven if you haven’t read the article, reading a QALMRI should provide you with enough information to get a basic idea of what the article was about. The following QALMRI summarizes our example article by Crump & Logan (2010).\n\nWhat was the broad and specific question?\nThe broad questions are about spatial cognition. How do people understand and represent the spatial relationships between objects in the environment? Do people have “spatial maps” in their head?\nThe specific question is how do typists know where the keys are on the QWERTY keyboard?\n\n\nWhat are the alternatives?\n\nTypists have an internal cognitive spatial map of the keyboard that they use to guide their fingers during typing\nTypists do not have a map-like representation, instead they rely on learned associations between cues such as the feel of the keyboard to guide their fingers during typing\n\n\n\nWhat is the logic?\n\nIf typists have an internal map of the keyboard, then they should be able to guide their fingers to correct locations based on the map alone and no feedback from the environment. For example, if we could measure “air-typing” without a keyboard, then typists should still be able to put their fingers in the correct locations even when the keyboard is missing because they are relying on their internal map.\nIf typists do not use an internal map of the keyboard, then their finger movements should become slow and inaccurate when they try to type without a keyboard, or in other conditions that change the normal feel of the keyboard, and thereby remove the cues that typists use to direct their fingers.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Method?\nTypists copied paragraphs in four conditions that manipulated tactile (touching) feedback from the keyboard. They typed on a normal keyboard, a keyboard with the keys removed exposing the rubber buttons underneath, a flat circuit board without, and on a flat table with a laser projection keyboard.\n\n\nResults\nTypists were fast and accurate in the normal keyboard condition. Typists were slow and inaccurate in all of the other keyboard conditions, where normal tactile feedback was removed.\n\n\nInference\nThe results are not consistent with the internal map hypothesis. If typists had an internal map, and did not rely on tactile cues, then they should have typed normally even when the cues were removed. The results are consistent with learned association hypothesis, that typists rely on cues, like the feel of the keyboard, that are associated with particular key locations."

Pronouns: she/her\nAbout me: I am a cognitive scientist who is fascinated by how humans think, learn, and communicate. My work involves conducting psychological experiments to understand different aspects of human behavior such as how we learn the meaning of words, how we search for information, and how we cooperate with one another. When I am not working, I enjoy playing board games, learning new recipes, and playing tennis (badly)! \nEmail: a.kumar@bowdoin.edu\nOffice: Kanbar Hall, Room 217\n\n\n\nTBD\n\n\n\nAbhilasha’s office hours (Kanbar 217): \n\nTBD\n\nLA’s office hours (Kanbar 200)\n\nTBD\n\nYou are strongly encouraged to drop-in during student/office hours - this is time specifically dedicated to you and any thoughts, questions, or concerns you may wish to share with me. If the designated hours don’t work for you, please email me to find a different time.\n\n\n\nThe mind is one of the biggest human puzzles, and scientific exploration of different aspects of the mind is the central goal of cognitive science. This lab course will expose you to modern techniques used in cognitive science that can be applied to the study of cognition. Together, we will learn how to develop a research question, conceptualize scientific experiments from start to finish, analyze experimental data, and communcate important insights about human cognition.\n\n\n\nIn addition to delving into some key aspects of cognition, my hope as an instructor is to empower you with an analytical toolkit that can be applied to other areas of your life. At the end of this course, you will be able to: \n\nDesign and conduct a web-based experiment about cognition [Department Goal #6]\nDescribe and analyze data [Department Goal #5]\nCommunicate scientific findings [Department Goal #7]\n\n\n\n\nAll of the course materials will be available in a timely fashion on this course website and/or posted on Canvas.\nStudents do not need to purchase or download any textbook - all materials will be made available (or are already available) on this course website or on Canvas\n\n\n\nThere are 15 total weeks in this course. In this course, we will learn how to design, analyze, and communicate the findings from a research study, through the lens of replication. We will learn how to design a web-based experiment that mirrors a recently published study on learning new words. We will then use data collected as part of a direct replication of this study to understand the basics of descriptive and inferential statistics. Armed with these tools, we will propose and implement conceptual replications and extensions of this study, collect and analyze real behavioral data, and communicate findings in a poster session as well as through a short report.\nThis is an in-person class, and students are expected to attend all class sessions.\n\n\n\nWeekly learning modules include three components to encourage engagement with the domain of intelligence in different ways.\nPREP: Most modules either have assigned readings or surveys/experiments. All material is freely available and posted on Canvas or the course website. Student are expected to complete the assigned material before classes where the material is discussed.\nTRY: At the end of each week, there will be a short online quiz where students will be expected to answer questions about the content covered during the week. These quizzes are meant to help you keep track of your progress and will count towards your final grade.\nAPPLY: At the end of each week or every other week, you will also have some formative assignments or project milestones due. These assignments will help you build on the skills you learn in class and review through the quiz, and apply them to actual tasks and problems you may encounter in psychological research."

Students are encouraged to choose the assignments that work best for them. Course assessments that occur throughout the semester are designed to help students set and achieve their own goals for engaging in course content.\n\nPoints\n\n\n\nComponent\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nWeekly quizzes\n25\n\n\nFormative assignments\n30\n\n\nFinal project\n40\n\n\nClass participation\n5\n\n\nExtra credit\n5\n\n\nTotal\n105\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Quizzes (25 points)\nAt the end of each weekly module, there will be a quiz that covers the content discussed in class through multiple-choice or true-false questions. You may take the quiz as many times as you’d like, but your average score will be recorded, i.e., if you get a really low score on the first attempt, it will impact your overall score even if you score 100% on the later attempt(s). Therefore, you are encouraged to review the weekly content before you attempt the quiz.\nOverall, these quizzes contribute 25 points towards your final grade, but each quiz will be graded for 5 points and then scaled to total up to 25 points at the end of the semester.\nPlease note that all assignments must be submitted before the due date each week (details on Canvas) to count towards the final grade - late submissions will NOT be accepted (unless you are using a flex day, see late work policy).\n\n\nFormative Assignments (30 points)\nAt different points during the semester, there will be 3 formative assignments that will help you assimilate the information you learn in class and through quizzes, and apply them in new contexts. These assignments will require you to adapt or write simple code to build parts of an experiment, test different aspects of design, or describe, manipulate, or infer statistics from data.\nOverall, these formative assignments contribute 30 points towards your final grade, with each assignment being worth 10 points each.\nNote: Making mistakes is part of the learning process. To incentivize correcting your mistakes on your formative assignments, you will be allowed to redo ONLY formative assignments any number of times to regain 50% of the points you lost, if you submit a revision within a week of receiving the previous points. For example, on a 10 point assignment, if you scored 7 points, and want to improve your score, you can resubmit your assignment within a week of when you received it, and you may earn back 50% of the 3 points you lost, i.e., 1.5 points. However, please weigh the costs of redoing the assignment against how many points you may be able to earn back. The last date to turn in assignment redos is December 18, 11.59 pm.\n\n\nFinal Project (40 points)\nIn this course, you will design a follow-up experiment based on a cognitive research study in a group, collect and analyze data from this follow-up study, and present your findings in a poster session and via a short report. Given that this will be a group project, you will be working with other classmates on several parts of the scientific process.\nGroups will be assigned in the first or second week of class based on student interests and schedule compatibility.\n\nMilestones\nThere will be several formative low-stakes milestones during the semester to ensure you are making steady progress towards the final project. Due dates for these milestones are available on Canvas. The breakdown of how the milestones contribute to your final project grade is below:\n\n\n\nMilestone\nPoints\n\n\n\n\n1: Team plan + articles\n2\n\n\n2: QALMRI + proposal\n2\n\n\n3: Anatomy\n1\n\n\n4: Design draft\n1\n\n\n5: Full Experiment\n5\n\n\n6: Pre-registration\n5\n\n\n7: Inferential Analyses\n5\n\n\n8: Poster draft\n2\n\n\n9: Poster presentation\n2\n\n\n10: Final report\n5\n\n\n11: Team skills\n5\n\n\nTotal\n40\n\n\n\n\nMilestone 1: Team Plan + Articles (2 points)\nThis assessment will happen relatively early in the semester. You will be expected to submit a document where you have discussed a plan for your project as well as selected some preliminary articles that you will be reading to develop the idea for your study.\n\n\nMilestone 2: QALMRI + proposal\nThis assessment will help you consolidate your ideas and research into an informal research proposal. You will first write QALMRIs for 6 research articles that your team has collectively read and reviewed, and then based on the QALMRIs, submit a jointly written 5-page literature review and proposal for your study. Note that your study must be a conceptual extension of the main study we will be replicating in class.\n\n\nMilestone 3: Anatomy\nThis assessment will help you understand the concrete elements of your research design. You will be required to submit a detailed mock-up of your experiment, including the stimuli and phases that you envision your experiment to contain.\n\n\nMilestone 4: Design Draft\nThis assessment is intended to help you put your ideas into practice. You will be required to submit code where you have implemented your experiment in jsPsych/HTML. This is a low-stakes assignment, where you will be provided feedback if you are running into issues.\n\n\nMilestone 5: Full Experiment\nFor this assessment, you will consolidate all the feedback from the previous milestone and submit the code for a nearly-final online experiment. At this point, you should have ironed out all the kinks in your design and your experiment should be ready for data collection.\n\n\nMilestone 6: Pre-registration\nIn this assessment, you will submit a pre-registration draft where you will clearly outline your hypotheses and planned analyses for your study. This draft will be reviewed by me, and you will actually pre-register your study after my approval.\n\n\nMilestone 7: Analyses\nIn this assessment, you will be required to compute some basic descriptive statistics from the data you have collected from your experiment and submit R code. You will also be expected to conduct statistical analyses and examine whether the data you have collected support your predictions and hypotheses. The goal is to get your comfortable with gleaning patterns and making inferences from real-world data.\n\n\nMilestone 8: Poster Draft\nUsing all the work you have done so far, you will now create a visually appealing poster draft that you will present in a poster symposium at the end of the semester. Your poster should deliver all the information a third observer will need to understand your study. You will be provided feedback on this draft.\n\n\nMilestone 9: Poster Presentation\nAt the end of the semester, all groups will present their poster to the Psychology department through a poster symposium. Your final poster and presentation skills will be observed and you will be expected to communicate your findings effectively to the audience.\n\n\nMilestone 10: Final Report\nAlthough all previous milestones will be graded on a group level, you will submit an individually written final report that combines your literature review, methods, and results into a coherent story and presents all the information in a short APA-style report.\n\n\nMilestone 11: Team Skills\nNo submission is required for this milestone. For each previous milestone, you will submit self and peer evaluations, and your grade for this milestone will be calculated by averaging all the scores you have received from your teammates during the semester.\n\n\n\n\nClass participation (5 points)\nStudents are encouraged to participate during class by responding to and reflecting on the course content, as well as engaging with other students via activities and group work. Your attendance will also count for some part of your class participation.\nOverall, here is a breakdown of how class participation will be assessed:\n\n\n\nComponent\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nIn-class participation and/or attending office hours\n3\n\n\nAttendance (attending 90% of classes)\n2\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nIn-class participation will be assessed based on how engaged you are in or outside class - this does not mean that you need to talk in each class or come to office hours every week, but I will be looking for engagement via participating in in-class activities, asking questions, volunteering answers, etc. on an overall basis.\nAttendance will be taken for each class and you will get full credit if you attend at least 90% of the class sessions. Beyond that, you will be assigned partial credit based on the number of classes you miss, i.e., 1 point will be deducted for each 10% drop in attendance (e.g., if you attend 80% of the classes, you will earn 4 points out of 5, if you attend 70% of the classes, you will earn 3 points out of 5, etc.)\n\n\nExtra credit (5 points)\nThere will be some opportunities to earn extra credit during the semester. These opportunities are described below:\n\nComplete class surveys (2 points) : There will be 4 surveys during the semester to gather your reflections and suggestions to improve the course. With the exception of the pre-class survey, all other surveys will be anonymous, and you will be able to earn 0.5 point for each survey you complete.\n Win Star Coder (1 point): You will submit 4 formative coding assignments during the semester. The two students who score the combined highest score on these assignments will earn 1 extra credit each.\n Win Team Player (1 point) : For each project milestone, your teammates will submit self and peer evaluations based on how the work was divided among the team members. The two students who receive the overall highest peer evaluation score at the end of the semester will earn 1 extra credit each.\n Win Memer of the Semester (1 point) : Each week, you will have the opportunity to submit a meme via Canvas, that reflects your experience with the course content of that week. Memes should be original, i.e., they should be course-specific and something you have created yourself and not simply found on the internet, although you are allowed to use common images/tropes from popular memes as a starting point. Memes also need to have a specific format, with the title of the learning module at the top of the meme (see Canvas). All memes will be gathered and sent to the class anonymously at the end of the semester for a survey, and the student(s) with the average highest score and the best scoring meme will both receive 1 additional point. Note: A student can only receive a maximum of 1 point through this mechanism, even if the same student has the highest average score in the context and the best scoring meme."

    "href": "articles/course_docs/syllabus.html#course-policies",
    "title": "Syllabus",
    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAcademic honesty and plagiarism\nWe, as a class, will abide by the Bowdoin College Academic Honor Code. While you are encouraged to discuss ideas and thoughts with your classmates, plagiarism in any form will be subject to grade reductions and disciplinary action. Specifically, you are permitted to make use of online resources and/or search platforms. However, directly copying or adapting written material and/or your classmates’ answers or ideas will be considered plagiarism. This policy applies to both individual and group assignments.\nPlease refer to this page for a list of resources related to plagiarism and other academic integrity issues. Here is another helpful infographic about plagiarism that you are encouraged to go over.\n\n\nElectronic devices\nMost of our class time will be spent in active learning and in-person/online activities that require the use of technology. Therefore, please bring a Macbook and iPad to class. Some students find it helpful to code on their Mac and use their iPad for looking at slides, so please consider bringing both devices to class.\nPlease make sure that your devices are fully charged when you arrive to class. In order to minimize distractions, please close or exit out of all other programs except those needed during class, and put your Mac/iPad on “work” mode. All class time should be devoted to working on in-class activities and group projects.\n\n\nAttendance: How many classes can you miss?\nIt not only benefits your learning, but benefits all of our learning to be present together in the same space. Class time is designed to take advantage of our presence together. To that end, your attendance will count towards your class participation.\nOf course, emergencies (illness or family emergencies) can and do occur. Note: If you are sick, please stay home. However, I would greatly appreciate that you email me if you will be missing class. If you miss more than 2 classes and I haven’t heard from you, I will be in touch to check in on you. Hopefully you will have connections to other students in the class and can find out what you missed from a classmate. I will also try my best to upload slides and other course materials on the website and/or on Canvas.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nSometimes, life doesn’t go as planned and you have way too much going on to turn things in on time. That is OKAY! This course has the following policies for late work:\n\nEach student has 3 “flex” days that they can use at their discretion throughout the semester. You can use all 3 days at once for a single assignment and turn in one assignment 3 days late (with no questions asked), OR you can spread the love across different assignments.\nFlex days can be used for ANY assignments (quizzes, formative assignments, project milestones) unless otherwise stated in class. However, if an assignment is a GROUP assignment (as will be the case for projects), EACH member of the group will need to count off their individual flex day for the flex day to count.\nIf you need to turn in work late and do not have any flex days left, I will consider extensions based on legitimate reasons, which ONLY include verified illnesses and/or family emergencies. In these cases, you are encouraged to reach out to me at least 24 hours in advance of the due date.\n\nWork that is handed in late beyond the flex days or without an approved extension will automatically be graded on 50% of the original points.\nUsing ONE flex day means you get a 24-hour extension. Please note that this is a strict extension and any work that is handed in beyond 24 hours after a flex day was requested will either need to use an additional flex day or will be graded on 50% of the original points.\nTo request a flex day, you can send me an email within the 24-hour extension window, or leave a comment on your submitted assignment on Canvas.\n\n\n\nInclusion\nI will do my very best to ensure that students from all backgrounds and perspectives receive equitable access and opportunity in this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class is viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I hope to employ materials and engage in activities and dialogue that are respectful of different aspects of your identity.\n\n\nReligious Holidays\nNo student is required to take an examination or fulfill other scheduled course requirements on recognized religious holidays. Students are expected to declare their intention to observe these holidays at the beginning of the semester.\n\n\nAccommodations\nStudents with documented Bowdoin-granted accommodations have a right to have these met. I encourage you to see me in the first 2 weeks of class to discuss how your accommodations may support your learning process in this course. I highly encourage all students to meet with me in the first few weeks of class to discuss your learning preferences, challenges you may face learning this semester, and how we can create an effective learning experience for you. If you are interested in learning more about accommodations please see Lesley Levy in the Office of Student Accessibility or visit Bowdoin’s website on accessibility-related policies and resources.\n\n\nCounseling Resources\nAs a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduced ability to participate in daily activities. Bowdoin College is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus at this link. The Dean of Students Office is also a resource for students facing personal and academic challenges. I encourage you to reach out to the amazing people in the dean’s office for a meeting anytime.\n\n\nLearning Resources\nThe Baldwin Center for Learning and Teaching offers peer-to-peer resources including mentors, Q-Tutors, and Writing Assistants. If you or your family are multilingual, you may also take advantage of Lisa Flanagan to work on writing and speaking assignments and projects. Tina Chong is available as an Academic Coach to work with you on goal setting, managing time, study habits and other strategies to support academic success. You are encouraged to make an appointment and learn more about how the Center can support your learning.\n\n\nOther resources\nIf you are on a budget or would benefit from financial assistance of any kind at any point in the semester, I encourage you to contact your Dean and explore the Supplemental and Emergency Funding website. The Office of the Dean of Students has grant and loan funds available to remove financial barriers so that students can more fully access the Bowdoin experience or to assist students with unexpected financial needs.\n\n\nMandated Reporter\nAs a faculty member, I am considered a Responsible Employee, per the Student Sexual Misconduct and Gender Based Violence Policy. As a Responsible Employee I am required to report disclosures of sexual misconduct, dating violence, stalking, and/or sexual and gender-based harassment to Bowdoin’s Title IX Coordinator, Kate O’Grady. My reporting does NOT mean that any actions will be taken beyond Kate reaching out to you and trying to schedule a time to talk to see what assistance you might need to be successful as a student here at Bowdoin. For more information please check out Bowdoin’s Title IX page."
