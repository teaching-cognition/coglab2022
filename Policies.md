# Course Policies

## Academic honesty

We, as a class, will abide by the Bowdoin College Academic Honor Code. While you are encouraged to discuss ideas and thoughts with your classmates, plagiarism in writing and code will be subject to grade reductions and disciplinary action. Specifically, you are permitted to make use of online resources and/or search platforms (Google/Stack Overflow), and are permitted to discuss conceptual ideas with your classmates for assignments. However, directly copying or adapting your classmate's code or writing will be considered plagiarism. This policy applies to both individual and group assignments. 

Please refer to [this](https://www.bowdoin.edu/dean-of-students/conduct-review-board/academic-honesty-and-plagiarism/index.html) page for a list of resources related to plagiarism and other academic integrity issues. [Here](https://myerslab.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/291/2022/05/Plagiarism-Infographic.pdf) is another helpful infographic about plagiarism that you are encouraged to go over.

## Electronic devices

Most of our class time will be spent designing experiments and analyzing data. Therefore, you are expected to bring your Bowdoin Macbook to class. Please make sure that your laptop is charged when you arrive to class. In order to minimize distractions, please close or exit out of all other programs except those needed during class. All class time should be devoted to working on in-class activities and group projects. 

## Attendance: How many classes can you miss? 
As many as you need and as few as you possibly can. It not only benefits your learning, but benefits all of our learning to be present together in the same space (virtual or in person). Class time is designed to take advantage of our presence together.

Of course, emergencies (illness or family emergencies) can and do occur. **Note**: If you are sick with COVID-19 or monkeypox, **please stay home**. However, I would greatly appreciate that you email me if you will be missing class. 

If you miss more than 2 classes and I haven’t heard from you, I will be in touch to check in on you. Hopefully you will have connections to other students in the class and can find out what you missed from a classmate. I will also try my best to upload slides and other course materials on the website and/or on Canvas.

## Late Work Policy

Sometimes, life doesn't go as planned and you have way too much going on to turn things in on time. That is **OKAY**! This course has the following policies for late work:

1. Each student has **3 "flex" days** that they can use at their discretion throughout the semester. You can use all 3 days at once for a single assignment and turn in one assignment 3 days late (with no questions asked), OR you can spread the love across different assignments. 
2. If you need to turn in work late and do not have any flex days left, I will consider extensions based on legitimate reasons, which ONLY include verified illnesses and/or family emergencies. In these cases, you are encouraged to reach out to me at least 24 hours **in advance** of the due date.   
3. Work that is handed in late beyond the flex days or without an **approved** extension will automatically be graded on 50% of the original points.

## Redoing Assigments

Making mistakes is part of the learning process. To incentivize correcting your mistakes on assignments, you will be allowed to redo ONLY **Assignments 1-7** **any** number of times to **regain 50% of the points you lost, if you submit a revision within a week of receiving the previous points**. For example, on a 10 point assignment, if you scored 7 points, and want to improve your score, you can resubmit your assignment within a week of when you received it, and you may earn back 50% of the 3 points you lost, i.e., 1.5 points. However, please weigh the costs of redoing the assignment against how many points you may be able to earn back. The last date to turn in assignment redos is **December 18, 11.59 pm**.

## Inclusion
I will do my very best to ensure that students from all backgrounds and perspectives receive equitable access and opportunity in this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class is viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. I hope to employ materials and engage in activities and dialogue that are respectful of different aspects of your identity. 

## Religious Holidays
No student is required to take an examination or fulfill other scheduled course requirements on recognized religious holidays.  Students are expected to declare their intention to observe these holidays at the beginning of the semester. 

## Accommodations
Students with documented Bowdoin-granted accommodations have a right to have these met. I encourage you to see me in the **first 2 weeks of class** to discuss how your accommodations may support your learning process in this course. I highly encourage all students to meet with me in the first few weeks of class to discuss your learning preferences, challenges you may face learning this semester, and how we can create an effective learning experience for you. If you are interested in learning more about accommodations please see Lesley Levy in the Office of Student Accessibility or visit [Bowdoin's website on accessibility-related policies and resources](https://www.bowdoin.edu/accessibility/).

## Counseling Resources
As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduced ability to participate in daily activities. Bowdoin College is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus at [this](https://www.bowdoin.edu/counseling/) link. The [Dean of Students Office](https://www.bowdoin.edu/dean-of-students/index.html) is also a resource for students facing personal and academic challenges. I encourage you to reach out to the amazing people in the dean’s office for a meeting anytime. 

## Learning Resources

The [Baldwin Center for Learning and Teaching](https://www.bowdoin.edu/baldwin-center) offers peer-to-peer resources including mentors, Q-Tutors, and Writing Assistants. If you or your family are multilingual, you may also take advantage of Lisa Flanagan to work on writing and speaking assignments and projects. Tina Chong is available as an Academic Coach to work with you on goal setting, managing time, study habits and other strategies to support academic success. You are encouraged to [make an appointment](https://www.bowdoin.edu/baldwin-center/make-an-appointment/ and learn more about how the Center can support your learning.

## Other resources

If you are on a budget or would benefit from financial assistance of any kind at any point in the semester, I encourage you to contact your Dean and explore the [Supplemental and Emergency Funding website](https://www.bowdoin.edu/dean-of-students/resources/emergency-funding/index.html). The Office of the Dean of Students has grant and loan funds available to remove financial barriers so that students can more fully access the Bowdoin experience or to assist students with unexpected financial needs.

## Mandated Reporter
As a faculty member, I am considered a **Responsible Employee**, per the Student Sexual Misconduct and Gender Based Violence Policy. As a Responsible Employee I am required to report disclosures of sexual misconduct, dating violence, stalking, and/or sexual and gender-based harassment to Bowdoin's Title IX Coordinator, Kate O'Grady. My reporting does NOT mean that any actions will be taken beyond Kate reaching out to you and trying to schedule a time to talk to see what assistance you might need to be successful as a student here at Bowdoin. For more information please check out [Bowdoin's Title IX page](http://www.bowdoin.edu/title-ix).
