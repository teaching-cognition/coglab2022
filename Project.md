# Group project

In this course, you will design a follow-up experiment based on the replication study in a group, collect and analyze data from this follow-up study, and present your  findings in a poster session. Given that this is a group assignment, you will be working with other classmates on several parts of the scientific process. This page contains important information about how to choose a topic, how to divide the work, and how your work will be evaluated.

## Choosing a follow-up study

When designing a follow-up study, you need to make sure:

1. The follow-up study directly *follows* from our original replication and answers one critical *main* question and a few critical *sub-questions* related to sentence processing.
2. Each member of the group is responsible for one critical sub-question posed by the follow-up study.

Please consult me during office hours or separate meeting times about your chosen follow-up study - I will work with you to make sure your study is conceptually strong and will be doable within the semester timeline.

## Assigning roles

Group work is hard. Therefore, to ensure that each member of the group is contributing equally, please make sure that you assign roles for each component of the project and report these roles back to me as part of the assignment submission.

## Grading for group project

Assignments 6-10 will all be based on this group project. However, some components will be graded at the *group* level, and other components will be graded at the *individual* level. Assignments graded at the group level will be submitted by the group as a whole and will receive a single score that will apply to all group members. Assignments graded at the individual level will be submitted by you individually and will receive individual scores, that may differ across group members.
